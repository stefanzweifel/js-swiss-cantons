![tests](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/js-swiss-cantons/workflows/tests/badge.svg)

Find any Swiss canton by its abbreviation, name, or by the zipcode of any Swiss city. (This is a port of [php-swiss-cantons](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/php-swiss-cantons))

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to work on this package you should have `npm`, `yarn` and `ava` installed globally.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/stefanzweifel/js-swiss-cantons.git
```

### Installing

You should install the package with `yarn` or `npm` in your project.

```shell
npm install @stefanzweifel/js-swiss-cantons
```

### Usage

There are 3 classes available in this package, with varying precision and tradeoffs:

- CantonManager
- ZipcodeSearch
- ZipcodeSearchSimple

#### CantonManager

Currently there are two methods available on the CantonManager Class: `getByAbbreviation` and `getByName`.

```javascript
import CantonManager from '@stefanzweifel/js-swiss-cantons';

let manager = new CantonManager();
let canton = manager.getByAbbreviation('SH');
let canton = manager.getByName('Schaffhausen');

console.log(
  canton.setLanguage('de').getName() // Schaffhausen
);
```

#### ZipcodeSearch

The ZipcodeSearch class can be used to find cantons by zipcode, be careful, it imports the entire zipcode dataset (~290kb).

```javascript
import ZipcodeSearch from '@stefanzweifel/js-swiss-cantons/src/ZipcodeSearch';

let search = new ZipcodeSearch();

let location = search.findbyZipcode('1201'); // Search by string
let location = search.findbyZipcode(8001); // Search by number

// Returns an object of the locality:
// {
//   "city_name": "ZÃ¼rich",
//   "zipcode": 8001,
//   "community_name": "ZÃ¼rich",
//   "canton": "ZH"
// }

You can also retrieve the whole dataset like this:
let locations = search.getDataSet();
```

#### ZipcodeSearchSimple

The `ZipcodeSearchSimple` class can be used to find cantons by zipcode, it imports much less data: 2.9Kb. The tradeoff is that it will find cantons for non-existent zipcodes, such as 5800, for which it will return `SO`, even though no city has that zipcode in Switzerland. This is because it searches for a canton in a range of zipcodes. For example, all zipcodes between 8001 and 8109 will return `ZH`, after which it will return `AG` until 8112. If you want more precision and/or data, use `ZipcodeSearch` instead.

```javascript
import ZipcodeSearchSimple from '@stefanzweifel/js-swiss-cantons/src/ZipcodeSearchSimple';

let search = new ZipcodeSearchSimple();

let location = search.findbyZipcode('1201'); // Search by string
let location = search.findbyZipcode(8001); // Search by number

// Returns a string
// 'GE'
// 'ZH'
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
